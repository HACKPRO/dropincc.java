dropincc.java
=============

### Specs.

* A small, and easy to use compiler generator;
* It forces some good practices during constructing lexer & grammer rules;
* It could add lexer & grammar rules on the fly and compiles at any time;
* It does not require you to learn another DSL for writing down lexer & grammer rules and provide a corresponding compiler to parse your rules. It just use java so it's ALL java(both its implementation and usage) and you can craft your own language at any time, anywhere in your application;
* It does not depend on any other third-party libs but just the JDK1.6(or above) library.
* It (is planned to) recognizes LL(*) grammer.
